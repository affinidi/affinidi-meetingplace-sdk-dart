# Affinidi Meeting Place - Core SDK for Dart

The Affinidi Meeting Place - Core SDK for Dart provides the toolkits to build a messaging app for a safe and secure method to discover, connect, and communicate with others (individuals, businesses, and AI agents) using Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and DIDComm v2.1 protocol. DIDComm v2.1 protocol enables a secure and private communication between entities using Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) as the basis of the user's identity when communicating, instead of the usual email address or phone number.

The Core SDK facilitates seamless, secure, and authentic communication between humans, AI agents, robots, and organisations, ensuring trust in digital interactions.

> **DISCLAIMER:** Affinidi provides this SDK as a developer tool to facilitate decentralized messaging. Any personal data exchanged or stored via this tool is entirely initiated and controlled by end-users. Affinidi does not collect, access, or process such data. Implementing parties are responsible for ensuring that their applications comply with applicable privacy laws and user transparency obligations.

## Core Concepts

- **Decentralised Identifier (DID)** - A globally unique identifier that enables secure interactions. The DID is the cornerstone of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a concept that aims to put individuals or entities in control of their digital identities.

- **DIDComm Message** - is a JSON Web Message (JWM), a lightweight, secure, and standardised format for structured communication using JSON. It represents headers, message types, routing metadata, and payloads designed to enable secure and interoperable communication across different systems.

- **Mediator** - A service that handles and routes messages sent between participants (e.g., users, organisations, another mediator, or even AI agents).

- **Out-Of-Band** - The protocol defined in DIDComm enables sharing a DIDComm message or invitation through a transport method other than a direct, established DIDComm channel, such as via a QR code or a URL.

- **Connection Offer** - An invite to connect containing description and vCard info of the publisher. Each connection offer is assigned with a unique passphrase that others can use to discover and accept the offer to connect.

## Key Features

- Support for multiple digital identities, ensuring privacy and anonymity when interacting with different entities across systems.
- End-to-end encryption of messages for more secure and private communication.
- Reduces spam by requiring the user's consent when other users try to establish a connection through the discovery mechanism.
- Implement the DIDComm Message v2.1 protocol, and connect and authenticate with different mediators that follow the same protocol.
- Seamlessly integrates with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), including Verifiable Credentials/Presentations.

## Decentralised Identity

Using other chat applications, you usually register with your email address or phone number as your identifier, which exposes users to privacy risks. The Core SDK allows users to have multiple identities to represent themselves in digital interactions, depending on the context, using a Decentralised Identifier (DID). For example, you can have an identity for work or finance; each profile has its own DID and contains different credentials.

Leveraging the DID and DIDComm protocol, it guarantees:

- Authenticity – Messages come from who they claim to be.
- Confidentiality – End-to-end encryption prevents leaks.
- Non-repudiation – Sender can't deny sending a message.

## Requirements

- Dart SDK `>=3.6.0 <4.0.0`

## Installation

Run:

```bash
dart pub add meeting_place_core
```

or manually, add the package into your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  meeting_place_core: ^<version_number>
```

and then run the command below to install the package:

```bash
dart pub get
```

Visit the pub.dev install page of the Dart package for more information.

## Usage

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:meeting_place_core/meeting_place_core.dart';
import 'package:ssi/ssi.dart';
import 'package:uuid/uuid.dart';

void main() async {
   final storage = InMemoryStorage();

   final aliceSDK = MeetingPlaceCoreSDK.create(
      wallet: PersistentWallet(InMemoryKeyStore()),
      repositoryConfig: RepositoryConfig(
         connectionOfferRepository: ConnectionOfferRepositoryImpl(storage: storage),
         groupRepository: GroupRepositoryImpl(storage: storage),
         channelRepository: ChannelRepositoryImpl(storage: storage),
         keyRepository: KeyRepositoryImpl(storage: storage),
      ),
      mediatorDid: 'did:web:samplemediator.affinidi.io:.well-known',
      controlPlaneDid: 'did:web:samplecontrolplane.affinidi.io', 
   );

   await aliceSDK.registerForPushNotifications(const Uuid().v4());

   final publishOfferResult = await aliceSDK.publishOffer(
      offerName: 'Example offer',
      offerDescription: 'Example offer to test.',
      vCard: VCard(values: {}),
      publishAsGroup: false,
      validUntil: DateTime.now().toUtc().add(const Duration(minutes: 5)),
  );
}
```
